# Smart-Education-System-SES-
The importance of technology in education is incontrovertible; the implementation comes with usage of hi-tech teaching aids and modern tools for easier and faster understanding of educational concepts. But the implementation of using technology in education has some disadvantage like CROWDED CLASSROOMS, LACK OF MONEY FOR MODERN Technology and boring system. So we try to use the hi-tech teaching with solving the mentioned problems in our project. S.E.S stands for Smart Education System, this system is consist of two main parts one of them is on the instructor PC that he can control his own pc by motion only, take the attendance, start live video each student can watch it by his phone, see the questions of students and share a file to them. The other part is on the students smart phones that they can receive any file that instructor send it, take they attendance, see the live video that instructor start it and if one of them has a question he can ask it through the application too.
